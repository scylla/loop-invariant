(** Prepare a function for CFG information computation by
  * {!Cil.computeCFGInfo}. This function converts all [Break], [Switch],
  * [Default] and [Continue] {!Cil_types.stmtkind}s and {!Cil_types.label}s into [If]s
  * and [Goto]s, giving the function body a very CFG-like character. This
  * function modifies its argument in place. *)
val prepareCFG: ?keepSwitch:bool -> fundec -> unit

(** Compute the CFG information for all statements in a fundec and return a
  * list of the statements. The input fundec cannot have [Break], [Switch],
  * [Default], or [Continue] {!Cil_types.stmtkind}s or {!Cil_types.label}s. Use
  * {!Cil.prepareCFG} to transform them away.  The second argument should
  * be [true] if you wish a global statement number, [false] if you wish a
  * local (per-function) statement numbering. The list of statements is set
  * in the sallstmts field of a fundec.
  *
  * NOTE: unless you want the simpler control-flow graph provided by
  * prepareCFG, or you need the function's smaxstmtid and sallstmt fields
  * filled in, we recommend you use [Cfg.computeFileCFG] instead of this
  * function to compute control-flow information.
  * [Cfg.computeFileCFG] is newer and will handle switch, break, and
  * continue correctly.*)
